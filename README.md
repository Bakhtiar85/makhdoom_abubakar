__Hi 👋 I am _Makhdoom Muhammad Abubakar Bakhtiar.___

Hello and welcome to my Git profile! 

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer specializing in Next.js and TypeScript.
I've been solving real-world problems through scalable web applications for 4 years.
I built [IRIS](https://iris.hellionstudios.com/) for a client - a platform that unifies Google services like Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive into one AI-Powered interface. So users can manage everything through a single chat.
At my current company, I have also developed a WhatsApp-based solution [QuoteM8](https://quotem8.ai/) for trade workers - (electricians, plumbers, and laborers) - who struggled with invoicing.
They now text their job details on WhatsApp, and the backend automatically generates formatted invoices and quotes for them. Its currently running in production. And I have also integrated the XERO accounting software with this product.
I've also built automation tools like [Orbity](https://orbity.site/), the Orbity helps freelancers by automatically hunting and filtering projects for them.
Most of my projects are open source and you can find them on GitHub. If you'd like a walkthrough or want to discuss how I can contribute to your team, let's connect.
